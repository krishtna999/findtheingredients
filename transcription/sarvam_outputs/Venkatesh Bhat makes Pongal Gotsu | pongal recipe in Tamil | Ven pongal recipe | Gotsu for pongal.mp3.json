Using Idhayam sesame oil and Idhayam groundnut oil, we are going to make many dishes using this oil. Today in this episode, we are going to make a fantastic... We are going to see Pongal and Kochu. Many people asked me about this Pongal, how to make Ven Pongal, how to make Sakkarai Pongal. Today, I am going to show you how to make Ven Pongal and Kochu. This is a recipe we were making at our Durga Bhavan. I am going to show you this recipe. I am going to share it. To make this Pongal, first we are going to cook it in a cooker with two ingredients. Those two ingredients are, one is moong dal, that is, moong dal. This moong dal and raw rice. These two, we need to use equal quantities. If you add one tumbler of green lentils, that is, moong lentils, then one tumbler of rice. It's okay to use regular rice for regular meals. But for Pongal, it should usually be a little mushy. To get that mushyness, what kind of rice should we buy? They call it 'new rice'. If you harvest now and use the rice that is 3 or 4 months old, it will wither quickly. If you take old rice, that old rice will be a bit grainy. It will be a little better. The rice will be of good quality. Now, I have green lentils here. In a cup. Now if you see, half a cup, in this cup, half a cup of moong dal. Same amount, half a cup. Need to add a little. Right. Same amount, half a cup of raw rice. Mix these two together and then in the water here. Wash it well. If the rice and lentils are less, wash it two or three times. Two to three times. It is not necessary to soak it. It is not necessary to marinate it. We can directly put it in the cooker. But before putting it in the cooker, wash it well two or three times. The step of draining this water is very, very important. Drain the water completely. That is, don't leave it saying it was only half a glass. Drain the water completely. After draining, put that rice and lentils in this cooker. Use the same container for measuring water as the one we used for rice and lentils. Because the measurement of water is very important. In Pongal, there is no specific rule for measuring water. The most important thing is the measurement of water. Everyone misses out. Either they add less water, or they add more water and make it like porridge. So, if you add water in the correct proportion, you can make it in a consistency that sits like a 100% Pongal laddu. Now, I have added 1 cup, that is, half a cup of semolina and half a cup of rice, so that's 1 cup. For this 1 cup, Here, I have water, one, two. Three, three and three-quarter cups. This is three and a quarter cups. So, however much rice and lentils I added together, rice and lentils together, I have added one cup. In that one cup, in the same cup, I have poured three and three-quarter cups of water. Poured and in this. Add a quarter spoon of ghee, and close the cooker. Light the stove. Exactly three whistles. Three whistles will come in approximately 8 to 10 minutes. After those three whistles come, keep it aside for about 5 to 10 minutes. Please don't take it off during the whistle. Because if you take it off immediately after those three whistles, the cooking won't happen fully. So you have to keep the whistle on. At least for 10 minutes, after the whistle is off, after the gas is off, the cooker should be stagnant for at least 10 minutes. Only then will the cooking happen inside. Your Pongal's cooking will be fully done. So I am going to put this on for three whistles. Before these three whistles come, how to make Kochu? Kochu is a fantastic combination for Pongal. This koch has many recipes. Some people make it with brinjal. Some people make it without adding onions. Some people make it with lentils. Some people make it without moong dal. Some people make it with tomatoes. Some people make it without brinjal, just with small onions. So, there are many recipes. I am going to show you a recipe that I am familiar with. In this, I am going to make it with lentils. I am going to make a gochchu with onion, tomato, and all that. We need to make a powder for that. Let's see how to make that powder and then how to make gochchu. Before that, I'm going to put this cooker inside and cook it for 3 whistles. Now, Let's light the stove and place a pan on it. I have used 1 teaspoon of Mantra groundnut oil. One, two, two and a half. Two and a half teaspoons of groundnut. Set the gas on a slow flame. I have added 2 and a half spoons of chana dal, in teaspoons. One, one and a quarter teaspoons of urad dal. Along with that, one, two teaspoons of coriander. One, two, three, four, five, six, eight dried chilies. Add all of these and roast it well. Add a quarter teaspoon of fenugreek to this. Don't add too much, it will become bitter. Just for that flavor, a quarter teaspoon of fenugreek. It's fried well. Turn off the gas. Before taking it off, add a little less than half a teaspoon of asafoetida. Add asafoetida and mix them well. Transfer it to a container. Once it's nicely heated, once it cools down, grind it into a fine powder and bring it. Now, I'll tell you how to make this kochu. I have oil here, it's castor oil. This should be made with castor oil only. I have added 2 tablespoons of castor oil. A little mustard. Let this mustard splutter. A little curry leaves. I have small onions here. I have peeled them. I am adding these small onions whole. You can even cut and add them. About 75 grams. Let this onion fry well. Those who don't use onions, those who say they don't add onions to gochchu, can avoid onions. You can directly add tomatoes. Some people don't even add tomatoes. Those who follow that recipe, please follow it. Many people asked how you keep the knife, how you maintain the knife, how you keep the knife sharp, and all that. I, my knives, mostly, whether it's bought in India or bought abroad, I... I won't give it to give dung outside, to do that dung. So when using a knife, the most important thing is the temper. There is a calculation for that steel, that knife, and that grip. There is a scientific calculation like how much is its length, how much is its handle. Its thickness and the thickness of this blade all depend on that. So, if we give it to them to suck dung, they will run it in that machine and remove the temper. It will be sharp for about 15 days. After that, once the temper is gone, you can't sharpen it at all. You have to keep sucking dung again and again. So, usually, with the knives you have at home, you can use a knife like this. Blunt side, that is, the side that is not sharp, the sharp side will be on this side, keep the side that is not sharp on your left hand. On your right hand, keep the knife you are going to cut with. The knife you are going to cut vegetables with. So, keeping that knife... Rub the sharp side with this blunt side like this. Doing this about 10 times is enough. Your knife will be sharp for the next 2 days. This onion is turning light brown. At this stage. Here, I have tomatoes. Just one tomato. Chop it like this. Okay. After chopping the tomato, add half a spoon of turmeric powder. Along with that, I have good eggplants here. You can use any eggplant you want. If it's a green eggplant, use a green eggplant. If it's a purple eggplant, use a purple eggplant. There isn't much difference in eggplants. You can use any eggplant you want. Cut the eggplant like this, and check if there are any insects inside. Cut it into small cubes, not like you would cut for sambar. Very big cubes shouldn't be available in the mouth. The eggplant should cook well in the eggplant pieces. Some people will roast the eggplant. They will directly show it on the stove and roast the eggplant well. Some people mash the burnt eggplant well and make pieces in it. So that will also be fantastic. It will have that smoky flavor. Those who have time can do it. This We have added turmeric powder to the tomato. At this stage, add these eggplants as well. Okay. Now, let's turn up the gas a bit. After turning it up, this eggplant, this tomato, this onion, all of this needs to cook for about 5 to 7 minutes on high flame. If you cook it for about 5 to 7 minutes in the domestic range, all of this will be cooked. Don't add salt. Add salt at the end. If you add salt earlier, the eggplant will become mushy. Salt and tamarind should always be added last when cooking eggplant. If you add it earlier, then the eggplant won't cook fully. It will be mushy. So, this eggplant, this onion, tomato, Let this turmeric powder boil well. For a good 5 minutes. See, after pouring that water, it has reduced to three-quarters. That tomato, onion, eggplant are well cooked. At this stage, I have tamarind water here that I have dissolved thickly. One spoon, a quarter spoon. That is, about 50 grams of tamarind, lemon size. Mix the tamarind, which is the size of a lemon, in hot water, soak it well for half an hour, and then if you squeeze it out, you'll get double the quantity I added now. In 50 grams. So, take half of it. Take half and put it inside. I've poured that half into this now. At this stage, the salt needed for this. After that, I have jaggery here that I have powdered. One teaspoon. Oh no, if I say I won't eat sweets or add jaggery, don't add it. Don't get stressed. It's okay, don't add it. We are adding this to the recipe to give it a slight sweetness. So, the dish will come out only if those ingredients are added. So, that's how I have been learning. So, I am teaching what I know. Okay, now this tamarind water, salt, and these vegetables are all fantastically cooked. At this stage, see, I have powdered it here. The one I roasted earlier, right, that has come powdered. That powder... One, two. Two teaspoons. I have added two teaspoons for this kothsu. Wow. Because it has chana dal and urad dal in it, it will give a little thickness. It will become nice and thick. Now, those who say, \"We don't add dal to kochu. We make kochu without using dal,\" can start eating it at this stage after taking it off the heat. No problem. Kochu is ready. But this... Another recipe, here I have moong dal, that is, green lentils, the green lentils that we call paasi paruppu, I have boiled and kept it. That paasi, boiled green lentils, one, two. Two spoons, approximately if you keep about 100 grams of lentils, about 100 grams. Pour a glass of water. Wow. Okay, come. For Pongal, the gochchu shouldn't be too thick. When you put it on the leaf, it should be a little thicker than sambar. It should be a little more watery than kurma. That's the consistency for gochchu. That's why we add this lentil. Look here. See the color. It's almost like our sambar. We add onions, we add tomatoes. Instead of sambar powder, we add a powder for gochchu. Similarly, we add moong dal. Let it boil once, then add a lavish sprinkle of coriander. That's all. Don't let it boil for too long. That's it. The kochchu is ready. Now, in the cooker, we have boiled the rice and lentils. After 3 whistles, we have given it 10 minutes of resting time and have boiled and kept it ready for the Pongal. In that boiled concoction, let's see how we are going to temper it, what we are going to do, and how the Pongal is going to be ready. Now, this is, after keeping it for 3 whistles and giving it approximately 10 minutes of resting time, when we take the whistle, after all the steam inside is gone, we take the whistle. Take it. Did you see? It should be cooked like this. Look at this. Ah, look at this. Oh my, oh my, oh my. Look at this. Look closely. This. Like it's needed for Pongal, if we use a spoon, it will become mushy. If you look without a spoon, it will be completely like rice. That's the beauty. So, as I told you earlier, follow the measurement I put in the measurement pan, in whichever vessel I put it. It will come out fantastically mushy like this. Now, to temper for Pongal, we'll place a pan, and we usually use Vanaspati in hotels. Because that's when it becomes like Pongal for Pongal. But now, if I say Vanaspati, you all are looking at me like I'm some kind of murderer. That's why I didn't use Vanaspati. I'll just make it with ghee. So, ghee. Everyone, close your eyes. Don't look at anyone. If you look, you'll see how much ghee there is. Okay, so. This is approximately three-quarters of a kilo of rice and lentils combined. It will definitely be half a kilo. It will definitely be around 500 to 600 grams. For that 500 grams, I have added 100 grams of ghee here. I have added ghee in a way that it is suitable for me to eat Pongal. If you like less ghee, you can add less. Or, you can even temper it without ghee. No problem. Remember this well. You need to be healthy. Even those who are healthy are facing problems. Even those who are not healthy are facing problems. Those who eat are healthy. Those who don't eat are healthy. Even those who don't eat are getting sick. So, nothing is in our hands. Eat well. Eat once in a while. I keep repeating the same thing to everyone. If you eat Pongal, don't eat 100 grams of ghee in Pongal four times a week. Eat Pongal once every 15 days or once a month. You can say that you can eat Pongal four times a month with less ghee. As far as I am concerned, even if I eat it once, I really like to eat it correctly. The most important thing in Pongal is the tempering you are about to see. This is what is going to determine your final taste. The most important thing is three things. One, curry leaves. It should be tender curry leaves. Don't buy mature curry leaves or ripe curry leaves, they won't be good. Use fresh curry leaves. The flavor of the curry leaves and the flavor of the asafoetida are most important. Asafoetida and curry leaves together make Pongal. If you don't have these two, it's a waste. Similarly, for ginger, definitely peel it well, otherwise it will taste bitter. Peel it and chop the ginger and keep it ready. So, there are small tricks like this for Pongal. So, it's very important. First, once this ghee is hot, I have kept pepper. One, one and a quarter spoons of pepper. Look closely, I've made it in this big cooker, that is, in this cooker. It's almost 600 grams. I'm telling you the measurement for these 600 grams that I'm adding now. If we add this pepper, the pepper should fry well. I have been making Pongal for about 25 years. This morning, I called my dad and asked, \"Is it correct that I am going to make Pongal like this?\" So, he told me, \"First, add pepper. If you add it and stand a little far away, it will explode.\" So, that's why I'm telling you, after adding pepper, stand a little far away, it will explode. Keep about half a teaspoon to one teaspoon, or three-quarters of a teaspoon, of cumin. Here, once the cumin turns slightly golden brown, I have ginger that I've peeled and chopped. Add about one and a half teaspoons, which means about 40 grams, 30 to 40 grams of ginger. Once that ginger's raw smell is gone, I have cashew nuts here. Cashew nuts are your convenience. It's a calculation that one cashew nut should come in one bite. When you eat Pongal, if you take one bite, you should get one cashew nut. So, if you say, \"No, no, I won't buy that many cashew nuts,\" then you can put less. Or don't put cashew nuts at all. Meanwhile, look here. This is very, very important. He has come from Afghanistan. Asafoetida. This asafoetida is now coming in many powders. Please don't use that powder asafoetida for Pongal. Solid asafoetida, that is, they call it gum asafoetida like this. This gum asafoetida is magic. Soak him in hot water for half an hour. He will stick to the bottom. Hey, come on. He will become mushy like this. I'll show him well on camera like this. Mix it like this. You can mix this like this, add a little asafoetida, put it in hot water, and after half an hour, mix it like this, and you can even keep it in the fridge. It won't spoil even if it's kept for a week or 10 days. If you add this to sambar or rasam, it will be amazing. After this golden brown comes... If you mix this well and leave it for even a minute, it will settle inside. So, don't leave it. Mix it well like this, and then add thick asafoetida water. One, two, three. That is, because you added 30 ml of water, that's why three. After adding that, there are tender curry leaves, fresh curry leaves. Just a good handful. Add curry leaves and turn on the gas. That asafoetida and that curry leaf, together both will boil. That's all. Turn off the gas. Now the asafoetida will be roasted to the required amount. Look at this curry leaf, it looks fresh, but it's fried in ghee. That kind of consistency. Finally, add the curry leaves and stir it like this. Add all of this. Is it added? Salt needed for Pongal. After adding that, look here. This ghee, that Pongal, that rice and lentils, the raw taste of the curry leaves that are not roasted. Those amazing cashew nuts that are golden in color here and there. That ghee on top of the Pongal, like applying makeup on the face. Aha! Now, on top of the head, here, there, there, here, in the middle, add 1 1/2 teaspoons of ghee, and in the same cooker, just cover it and keep it aside. Don't disturb him for the next 20 minutes. Now, if you see, it's the kothsu we made. Look, as I said, it's thicker than sambar, and a little more watery than kurma. In this consistency, this is oats, and a little coriander on top of his head. Aha! Tada! A small technology. In this ladle, I have covered the cling foil, you know, the one we use to cover food. I have covered that cling foil. Polythene cover, milk cover, whatever you want, put a rubber band on it. What happens is, when it falls, it just... It will fall with a thud. Look here. He will come like a ball and sit down. It will take him 15 minutes to settle down. So, like that, a Pongal.
